# Pokedex project

## Again ? Freaking again ? 😨

Pokemons are everywhere in our lives and we know that Pokedex projects are everywhere too. But you know what ? I don't really care and I decided to train myself with that.

In my programming courses, I should have done that with AltoRouter and basic MVC. But I want to try with something else and Symfony was my spec so I'll do that with musicality, despite it's not a good tech choice for that kind of project. 

## What am I practicing ? 🤜

MVC logic, Symfony and twig templates management with a little Rest API builded. I did integration too and it's responsive. <br>
I added some functionalities to improve the UX, here's some examples : pagination when its needed, Pokemon research by name, return to the top of the page.

## Something you should know ✍️

Strictly speaking, my projects will not be "finished" at all and they'll keep being improved over the time.<br>
